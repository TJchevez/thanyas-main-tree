Side Hobby - a landing page where you can see a layout of what I do
The goal of this website is to showcase my poetry, blogs, and what I'm currently working on. 
I haven't created a deadline for this project and still need to come up with the layout.
For an idea of the layout out I want it be interactive and fun for the user to explore.
At this point of the process, its best to design it on a Figma file so that coding will be easier.
