The goal of this website is to showcase my poetry, blogs, and what I'm currently working on. 
For an idea of the layout out I want it be interactive and fun for the user to explore.
Even though I haven't really gotten started yet, I know this will be so fun to build.
I just been on a job hunt and getting sharper practicing my coding skills. 
Which is taking up so much of my time but the wait will be worth it.
